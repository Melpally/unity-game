# Unity Project

##### Download and execute the executable file called "The newest game" to play and test the game #####
This is an independent game devlopment project, where I created a 2D game similar to flappy bird.The logic is to get to the finish line on top by avoiding the collisions with the so-called "enemies", which essentially are animated objects aimed at incresing the difficulty. The Bolt Visual Scripting Tool was used for this project.
